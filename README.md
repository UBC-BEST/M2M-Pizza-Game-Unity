N/A <br/>

### Instructions
* To start, clone this repo to your machine. <br/>
* To start working on a feature, create a new branch off of ```master``` named ```feature-your-branch-name```, and add it to the remote repo so everyone can see it. <br/>
* Alternatively, if you are fixing a bug, name your branch ```bugfix-your-branch-name```. You shouldn't have a need to create other kinds of branches. <br/> 
* Once you've committed everything, create a pull request to ```master``` and shoot Wesley or Ripdaman a message so they know to check it. <br/>
* Once either of them have gone through your changes, they will merge your code with ```master```. From there, you can pull ```master``` to your machine, and you should see all your changes. <br/>
* Take a nap :)
